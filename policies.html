              <li>**2.1. Final Sales:** All sales of premium services, subscriptions, and digital content on PayHub are considered **final**.

**2.2. No Refunds:** Once a payment has been successfully processed and access to the premium service has been granted, PayHub will **not** issue refunds, partial refunds, or credits under any circumstances. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where:

The User decides not to use the purchased service.
The User's account is suspended or terminated due to a violation of PayHub's Terms of Service (including, but not limited to, non-payment).

The payment commitment was made via a support ticket or other direct agreement, and the User subsequently refuses payment or requests a refund.
**2.3. Pre-Purchase Due Diligence:** Users are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review all service descriptions, pricing, and these terms prior to making a purchase to ensure the service meets their needs and expectations.</li>
